# Minesweeper-Assembly

A full implementation of the classic Minesweeper game written entirely in x86 Assembly.

## Features
- 9×9 game board with random mine placement
- Recursive opening of empty cells
- Flag placement and win/lose detection
- Low-level graphics rendering using BIOS interrupts
- Keyboard input handling

## Technologies
- x86 Assembly (16-bit, DOS)
- BIOS interrupts (INT 10h, INT 21h)

## Purpose
This project was built to practice low-level programming concepts such as memory management, recursion, control flow, and direct hardware interaction.
